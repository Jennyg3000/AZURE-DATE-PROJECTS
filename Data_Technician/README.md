### 💻  Azure & Database Practice

This module includes practical, lab-based tasks focusing on data management in a cloud environment.

* **Lab 1 (DP-900):** Explore Relational Data in Azure.
* **Lab 2 (SQL):** SQL querying practice using the **AdventureWorks DB**. Queries include:
    * Filtering customers using `LIKE` (`A%`, `%a`, `%o%`).
    * Finding top products based on price and color.
    * Calculating aggregate statistics (`AVG`, `SUM`, `COUNT`) and margins.
    * Subqueries (Products priced above average).
    * Joining tables (Orders with Customer Information).
* **Lab 3 (DP-900):** Explore Non-relational Data in Azure.

### ☁️  Assessments & Architectural Scenario

This module contains final assessments and an optional task requiring solution architecture.

* **MS Fabric Lab:** Completion of Data Factory end-to-end tutorial.
* **DP-900 Practice:** Team-based practice assessment for the Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals exam.
* **Optional Scenario: "Paws & Whiskers" Pet Shop**
    * **Data Laws:** Identify relevant laws (GDPR, DPA 2018).
    * **Azure Services:** Recommend storage (Blob, Azure SQL), analysis tools (Azure ML, Synapse Analytics), and integration (Azure Data Factory).
    * **Data Modelling:** Define data categories (demographics, transactions, inventory) and propose a relational/data warehouse approach.
    * **Storage & Security:** Discuss Parquet/JSON formats and Azure's built-in encryption.
    * **Additional Considerations:** Backup (Azure Backup), Visualization (Power BI), and Future Scalability.
